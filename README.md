# Hello new rust!

I noticed glitch has a really outdated rust version, so I decided to do something about it.

This project allows you to run up-to-date rust apps with minimal effort, however, they will take
a while to start up whenever they are shut down due to inactivity.

In this example, we are running an async RustðŸ¦€ program that serves a simple .http and .html combo.
It is now interactive, that would go beyond the scope of this demo.

## Awesome, how do I use it?

You can put any rust project you want in the rust_app/ directory. It will then be run using the 
latest stable rust release.
